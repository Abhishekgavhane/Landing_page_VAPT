    <h1>The Overview</h1>
    <p>Vulnerability Assessments are a process of identifying, quantifying, and vulnerabilities
        in a system. Both the services have a different purpose and are carried out to achieve
        different but complementary objectives. VA and PT differ from each other in two ways.
        The VA process gives a horizontal map into the security position of the network and the application,
        while the PT process does a vertical deep dive into the findings. In other words,
        the VA process shows how big a vulnerability is, while the PT shows how bad it is.</p>

    <p><strong style="font-size: 30px">Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT)</strong> <br><br> Tools attack your system within the network
    and outside the network as if an hacker would attack it. VAPT gives a more detailed view of threats
    that your network or application is facing. It helps enterprises to protect their data and system
    from malicious attacks. VAPT is important to accomplish compliance standards. Protect your business from
    data loss and unauthorized access.</p>

            <br>
            <ul>
            <li>Any and all devices with an IP address can be considered for a VAPT activity.</li>
            <li>Penetration Testing should focus on yours organizations external parameters(IP Addresses,
                people, etc.) </li>
            <li>Vulnerability Assessment should focus on your internal infrastructure <br>
                (servers, databases, switches, routers, desktops, firewalls, loptops, etc.)</li>

    <p>Mobile applications have become a significant aspect of our everyday life as the reliance
        of people on Smartphones has generously enlarged. Be that as it may, a lot of clients are
        as yet oblivious of their gadgets' security. Wellbeing can regularly turn into a bogus
        observation on the off chance that we don't have any thought of how our applications were
        created just as infiltration testing.</p>
    <p>The most valuable approach to maintain a strategic distance from any security hazard is to
        choose Mobile Application VAPT that holds the intensity of giving us a positive degree of
        certainty with regards to security upkeep. As per different investigations, over 80% of
        portable application clients have the conviction that their versatile account and wellbeing
        applications are entirely secure. Primer point of leading the Mobile App infiltration test is
        to perceive all exploitable weaknesses in the application or system that can conceivably get
        abused by the hackers.</p>

            (i.e., switches, switches), and has before programmers can find just as adventure them.</p>
        <p>IT Network Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing is the methodology directed by
            security specialists for discovering potential weaknesses inclined to be misused by the
            malicious attack.</p>
